How does it look when autonomous cars aren't able to stabilise the system?

In dense environments, autonomous cars can contain traffic waves within the cascade but still fail to completely mitigate them.
In our paper, these situations are also marked as unstable.

Here is an example of an INCOMPATIBILITY of the governing equations with obstacles such as traffic lights.

The velocity delta becomes greater than the velocity error causing the autonomous cars to speed through the traffic light.

Our simulation can also be used to investigate how phantom traffic behaves. Here we see 4 phantom traffic jams merge into 3, which then merge into 2.

Here we can see how autonomous cars eliminate the traffic waves. (although it fails to stabilise the whole system)
